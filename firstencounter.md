# First Gathering for NodeSchool Madrid

On 2015-03-03 the first meatspace gathering was held,
under the umbrella of Node.js Madrid: the local Meetup for Node.js devs,
which I also organize.

This analysis should help others (and ourselves in the future)
make less mistakes when organizing gatherings.

I will add lessons as blockquotes:

## Preparation

In preparation for the Meetup I requested volunteers to perform as mentors
for NodeSchool Madrid.
The response was fantastic: there were no less than 12 volunteers,
of which 10 went to the first gathering.

I tried to spread the word around as much as possible, both online and offline:
Twitter, student associations, companies, other meetups.
I could not have done it without the help of the mentors and other colleagues,
and we were quite successful:
at some point 250 people had signed up at Meetup.com, although the numbers
went down to 216 at the moment of the gathering.

### Materials

I asked all mentors to do at least the first two tutorials:
[javascripting](https://github.com/sethvincent/javascripting)
and [learnyounode](https://github.com/rvagg/learnyounode),
and did the same myself.
I have to confess that the modules bit lost me somehow,
but it was not an issue at the gathering.

I explained on the [Meetup page](http://www.meetup.com/Node-js-Madrid/events/220356931/)
the basic requirements from the official page:
bring your own laptop,
preinstall Node.js and the first two tutorials,
and a text editor of your choice.

## Gathering

About 130 people showed up;
this huge number strained a bit the capacity of everyone involved.

### Venue

[Medialab-Prado](http://medialab-prado.es/) is a municipal organization devoted to open technologies,
which occupies an awesome building very near the Museum Triangle,
in the heart of the city. We had reserved the canteen,
which the organization had told us could hold up to 40 people.

The "facilitators" there (contractors for the organization)
complained a lot about the number of people,
but in the end helped us make it a success.

> Let the venue know your prevision of attendance beforehand,
> specially if you expect a lot of people.

Luckily the facilitators were now quoting an "absolute maximum of 120 people",
which left us some margin.
After that number we had to watch ourselves that no one else accessed the space.
The first unlucky supernumerary NodeSchoolers were turned back;
after that we suggested them to go to a different room in Medialab,
and promised that some mentors would go there to check up on them.

### Attendance

We were extremely lucky to have 60% of people that had signed up;
it may look like a low number, but for Node.js Madrid it is approximately
our best percentage ever.

The facilitators also complained that we had not limited the number of attendees,
which was not something I was willing to do since their policy is
"open access":
anyone coming from the street should be able to participate.
Limiting attendees on Meetup would have meant leaving people out,
and probably free spaces in the gathering.

> Try to have people sign up somewhere; it helps you estimate attendance.
> Plan to have only 50~60% of people to show up.

### Amenities

### Activities

When people had arrived and calmed down a bit, we explained what we had come to do:
learn Node.js together using the [tutorials](http://nodeschool.io/#workshopper-list).

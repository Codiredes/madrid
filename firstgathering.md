# First Gathering of NodeSchool Madrid (2015-03-03)

On March 3rd 2015 the first meatspace gathering of the Madrid chapter of NodeSchool was held,
under the umbrella of [Node.js Madrid](http://www.meetup.com/Node-js-Madrid/):
the local Meetup for Node.js devs,
which I also organize.
About 130 people showed up;
it was very productive for attendees and great fun for everyone involved.

This analysis is done with the intention of helping others (and ourselves in the future)
make less mistakes when organizing gatherings.

I will write important lessons we have learned as blockquotes:

## Preparation

In preparation for the gathering I requested volunteers to be mentors.
The response was fantastic: there were no less than 12 volunteers,
of which 10 went to the first gathering.

For students, I tried to spread the word around as much as possible, both online and offline:
Twitter, student associations, companies, other meetups.
Mentors and other colleagues also helped a lot,
and altogether we were quite successful:
at some point 250 people had signed up at Meetup.com, although the numbers
went down to 216 at the moment of the gathering.

### Materials

I asked all mentors to do at least the first two tutorials:
[javascripting](https://github.com/sethvincent/javascripting)
and [learnyounode](https://github.com/rvagg/learnyounode),
and did the same myself.
I have to confess that the modules exercise was too complex and required too much effort,
so I left it there,
but it was not an issue at the gathering.

> There is a a big gap between javascripting and learnyounode;
> some basic Node.js exercises would be most welcome.

I explained on the [Meetup page](http://www.meetup.com/Node-js-Madrid/events/220356931/)
the basic requirements from the official page:
bring your own laptop,
preinstall Node.js and the first two tutorials,
and have ready a text editor of your choice.

## Gathering

About 130 people showed up;
this huge number was a success, even if it strained a bit the capacity of everyone involved.

### Venue

[Medialab-Prado](http://medialab-prado.es/) is a municipal organization devoted to open technologies,
which occupies an awesome building very near the Museum Triangle,
in the heart of the city. We had reserved the canteen,
which the organization had told us could hold up to 40 people.

The "facilitators" there (contractors for the organization)
complained a lot about the number of people,
but in the end helped us make it a success.

> Let the venue know your prevision of attendance beforehand,
> specially if you expect a lot of people.

Luckily the facilitators were now quoting an "absolute maximum of 120 people",
which left us some margin.
After that number we had to watch ourselves that no one else accessed the space.
The first unlucky supernumerary NodeSchoolers were turned back;
after that we suggested them to go to a different room in Medialab,
and promised that some mentors would go there to check up on them.

### Attendance

We were extremely lucky to have 60% of people that had signed up;
it may look like a low number, but for Node.js Madrid it is approximately
our best percentage ever.

The facilitators also complained that we had not limited the number of attendees,
which was not something I was willing to do since their policy is
"open access":
anyone coming from the street should be able to participate.
Limiting attendance in Meetup would have meant leaving people out,
and probably leaving free spaces in the gathering.

> Try to have people sign up somewhere; it helps you estimate attendance.
> Plan to have only 50~60% of people to show up.

A quick show of hands told us that almost all attendees had followed the instructions:
everyone had their laptops, all but a handful of people had Node.js installed,
and just 20~30 had not installed the tutorials.

A sore point was diversity: women were below 10% of attendees,
and almost everyone were Spanish-born and in the 30~40 age range.
I would have liked to have more women show up,
more people of different nationalities (including Europeans, South Americans and Africans
which make up the majority of foreigners in Spain),
and more young or old people. But you can only do so much.

> Reach out to women, student and foreign communities.
> Diversity is essential in a healthy community.

### Facilities

The organization lent us lots of extension cords and socket adaptors,
much needed in a room full of hungry laptops.

WiFi was working well, so people who had not installed the tutorials had no problems
doing it then.

Some people had asked for a webcast or a recording of the gathering.
It made no sense given the nature of the session:
there were no talks or explanations of tutorials,
everyone was supposed to follow them at their own pace.

Despite being held in the canteen, there were no refreshments or food of any kind.
This might have seemed a disadvantage,
but in a room with 120 people and full of laptops things could have got messy quickly.

### Activities

When people had arrived and settled down a bit, we explained what we had come to do:
learn Node.js together using the [tutorials](http://nodeschool.io/#workshopper-list).

![Explaining the basics](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nodeschool/madrid/master/img/nodeschool-start.jpeg)

From that point on we just wandered around between the tables, and answered any questions.
I tried to actively ask at least all tables once if everything was going smoothly.
Truth be told, I fielded about 7 questions all in all,
and only one of them was really hard:
the [juggling async](https://github.com/rvagg/learnyounode/blob/master/exercises/juggling_async/problem.md)
exercise in the learnyounode tutorial.

At some point two of us went upstairs to see how the late-coming guys and girls
(those that did not fit in the canteen) were doing. We solved a few issues.
After a while some spaces cleared downstairs and this group merged with everyone else.

> Try to deliver on your promises, even if it means giving some people special attention.

### Attention and Mentors

Someone asked how they could recognize mentors; we replied that we would be
the only ones walking between the tables.

> Mentors might wear NodeSchool t-shirts so they are easier to spot.

Mentors tended to cluster together at one end of the canteen.

> Mentors should be encouraged to move around, even if nobody is asking questions.
> People may be working quietly, but if somebody asks them directly
> they express their issues with more liberty.

Concentration was high all the time: at no point did we need to hush people,
even though many people had come in groups.
There were also no disruptions worth of mention.

## Aftermath

One of the key points of the gathering was to provide for support later on
to those brave souls that kept working on the tutorials afterwards.

### Slack

We set up an [account on Slack](https://nodeschoolmadrid.slack.com/) before the gathering.

We asked people to write their mail addresses on a piece of paper if they were interested,
and I sent a followup email offering to invite them with my email address.

> Slack is a nice platform, but the lack of self-invites is annoying:
> admins have to invite everyone.

We have 82 people in our Slack right now.
To be honest there is an unexpected paucity in questions:
up to this point there have been very few questions about the tutorials.

> Do not expect too many online questions.

### Next Event

People are already asking for the next gathering. We mentors have agreed
to do it again in a couple of months, to allow for some hype to build up.
